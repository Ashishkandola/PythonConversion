    "Reserved Words: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords or reserved words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length: There is no limit on the length of an identifier, but it a good practice to keep them concise and descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Special Characters: Identifiers cannot contain special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc.\n",

    "Conventions: It a convention in Python to use lowercase letters for variable names and lowercase or lowercase_with_underscores for function and method names. Class names typically use CamelCase convention.\n",
